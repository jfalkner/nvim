# Example Neovim Configuration and Documentation

I've use Neovim and wanted to better save and share my configuration file. If you are new to Neovim (or VIM) then you may find this helpful.

### Why make this a repository?

* Easy to redownload my preferred config on any machine
* Help others learn Neovim. Either by copy-pasta or finding my documentation helpful.

Copy the init.vim file to your `~/.config/nvim/` directory then start nvim.

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jfalkner/nvim/main/init.vim /.config/nvim/
