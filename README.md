# Jayson's NeoVIM Configuration and Documentation

I've switched to NeoVIM and wanted to better save my configuration file. This repository has both the file and documentation about what is in the file. If you are new to NeoVIM (or VIM) then you may find this helpful.

### Why make this a repository?

* Easy to redownload my preferred config on any machine
* Help others learn NeoVIM. Either by copy-pasta or finding my documentation helpful.

### How to use

Copy the init.vim file to your /.config/nvim/ directory then start nvim.

'''
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jfalkner/nvim/main/init.vim /.config/nvim/
